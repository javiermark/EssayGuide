                <p>
                    The invention of Braille marked a major turning point in the history of disability. The writing system of raised dots used by blind and visually impaired people was developed by Louis Braille in nineteenth-century France. In a society that did not value disabled people in general, blindness was particularly stigmatized, and lack of access to reading and writing was a significant barrier to social participation. The idea of tactile reading was not entirely new, but existing methods based on sighted systems were difficult to learn and use. As the first writing system designed for blind people‚Äôs needs, Braille was a groundbreaking new accessibility tool. It not only provided practical benefits, but also helped change the cultural status of blindness. This essay begins by discussing the situation of blind people in nineteenth-century Europe. It then describes the invention of Braille and the gradual process of its acceptance within blind education.

            <h2>Writing the Main Body</h2>
            <p>
                The body of your essay is where you make arguments supporting your thesis, provide evidence, and develop your ideas. Its purpose is to present, interpret, and analyze the information and sources you have gathered to support your argument.
            </p>
        
            <h3>Length of the Body Text</h3>
            <p>
                The length of the body depends on the type of essay. On average, the body comprises 60‚Äì80% of your essay. For a high school essay, this could be just three paragraphs, but for a graduate school essay of 6,000 words, the body could take up 8‚Äì10 pages.
            </p>
            <p>
                We recommend trying QuillBot‚Äôs <a href="#">Word Counter</a> for metrics like the readability level and word count of your essay.
            </p>
        
            <h3>Paragraph Structure</h3>
            <p>
                To give your essay a clear <a href="#">structure</a>, it is important to organize it into <a href="#">paragraphs</a>. Each paragraph should be centered around one main point or idea.

            <h2>Writing the Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                The conclusion is the final paragraph of an essay. It should generally take up no more than 10‚Äì15% of the text. A strong essay conclusion:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>‚úÖ Returns to your thesis</li>
                <li>‚úÖ Ties together your main points</li>
                <li>‚úÖ Shows why your argument matters</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                A great conclusion should finish with a memorable or impactful sentence that leaves the reader with a strong final impression.
            </p>
        
            <h3>What Not to Include in a Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                To make your essay‚Äôs conclusion as strong as possible, there are a few things you should avoid. The most common mistakes are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>‚ùå Including new arguments or evidence</li>
                <li>‚ùå Undermining your arguments (e.g. ‚ÄúThis is just one approach of many‚Äù)</li>
                <li>‚ùå Using concluding phrases like ‚ÄúTo sum up‚Ä¶‚Äù or ‚ÄúIn conclusion‚Äù</li>
            </ul>
